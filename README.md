# Introduction
Everyday we come across various products in our lives, on the digital medium we swipe across hundreds of product choices under one category. It will be tedious for the customer to make selection. Here comes 'reviews' where customers who have already got that product leave a rating after using them and brief their experience by giving reviews. As we know ratings can be easily sorted and judged whether a product is good or bad. But when it comes to sentence reviews we need to read through every line to make sure the review conveys a positive or negative sense. In the era of artificial intelligence, things like that have got easy with the Natural Langauge Processing(NLP) technology.

# What is sentiment analysis?
Sentiment Analysis is the most common text classification tool that analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative our neutral.Understanding peopleâ€™s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before.It is quite hard for a human to go through each single line and identify the emotion being the user experience.Now with technology, we can automatically analyzing customer feedback, from survey responses to social media conversations, brands are able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.

# Objectives of Project
Reviews Preprocessing and Cleaning
Story Generation and Visualization from reviews
Extracting Features from Cleaned reviews
Model Building: Sentiment Analysis

# Insights:
Considering the ROC curve for classes, class 2 and 0 have been classified pretty well a their area under the curve is high. We can chose any threshold between 0.6-0.8 to get the optimal number of TPR and FPR
Coming to micro and macro average, micro average preforms really well and macro average shows a not very good score
If you don't understand what micro and macro average is, just remember the following 'A macro-average will compute the metric independently for each class and then take the average (hence treating all classes equally), whereas a micro-average will aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric. In a multi-class classification setup, micro-average is preferable if you suspect there might be class imbalance'.

# Conclusion
We have done a pretty neat job on classifying all the classes starting from splitting the sentiments based on overall score,text cleaning, customize the stopwords list based on requirement and finally handling imbalance with smote. Here are few insights from the notebook.
Consider welcoming ngram in sentiment analysis as one word can't give is proper results and stop words got to be manually checked as they have negative words. It is advised to avoid using stop words in sentiment analysis
Most of our neutral reviews were actual critic of product from the buyers, so amazon can consider these as feedback and give them to the seller to help them improve their products
Most of the reviews in this dataset were about string instruments such as guitar.
Balancing the dataset got me a very fruitful accuracy score. Without balancing, I got good precision but very bad recall and inturn affected my f1 score. So balancing the target feature is important
In sentiment analysis, we should concentrate on our f1 score where we got an average of 94% so we did a pretty good job
